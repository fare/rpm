RPM

This library allows you to manipulate RPM packages from CL.


==== Exported Functionality ====

The rpm library creates a package RPM,
that exports the following macros and functions:

PARSE-RPM-VERSIONED-NAME STRING &KEY START END
  parses the STRING (within START and END bounds)
  as an rpm versioned package name, returning as multiple values two strings,
  one for the base package name and the other for epoch, version and release.
  e.g. "foo-1.4-6" ==> "foo" "1.4-6"

RPM-VERSIONED-NAME-BASENAME STRING
  from a rpm versioned package name, extract the base package name.
  e.g. "foo-1.4-6" ==> "foo"

RPM-VERSIONED-NAME-VERSION STRING
  from a rpm versioned package name, extract the epoch, version and release.
  e.g. "foo-1.4-6" ==> "1.4-6"

PARSE-RPM-PATHNAME PATHNAME
  from the designator of a pathname to a RPM, extract as multiple values:
  * the pathname of the parent directory
  * the base name of the package
  * the epoch:version-release string
  * the architecture
  e.g. "/tmp/foo-1.4-6.x86_64.rpm" ==> #P"/tmp/" "foo" "1.4-6" "x86_64"

RPM-PATHNAME-PACKAGENAME PATHNAME
  from the designator of a pathname to a RPM,
  extract the base name of the package
  e.g. "/tmp/foo-1.4-6.x86_64.rpm" ==> "foo"

RPM-PATHNAME-VERSION PATHNAME
  from the designator of a pathname to a RPM,
  extract the epoch:version-release string
  e.g. "/tmp/foo-1.4-6.x86_64.rpm" ==> "1.4-6"

RPM-VERSION= V1 V2
RPM-VERSION<= V1 V2
RPM-VERSION< V1 V2
RPM-VERSION>= V1 V2
RPM-VERSION> V1 V2
  compares the two given epoch:version-release strings,
  and returns T if the first is respectively
  equal, lesser or equal, lesser, greater or equal, or greater
  than the second one as far as RPM is concerned.

RPMS-INSTALLED &KEY PACKAGENAMES HOST
  return a list of versioned packagenames for the RPM packages installed
  on specified HOST (default: NIL, denoting current host),
  that match the list of names specified in PACKAGENAMES,
  or all packages if PACKAGENAMES is T (the default).

RPMS-TO-UPDATE DESIRED-RPMS &KEY HOST TEST
  given a list of DESIRED-RPMS of pathnames to RPM packages,
  a host HOST (default NIL, denoting current host),
  a test TEST (default RPM-VERSION<=, allowing newer versions than desired),
  return a list of the RPMs to install so all RPMs of given packagenames
  will be install and of a version satisfying the test with the desired version.
  With the default test RPM-VERSION<= this means that the desired RPM won't be
  listed if an existing more recent version is installed, whereas if you supply
  :TEST RPM-VERSION= then the desired RPM will only be skipped if
  an exact matching version is already installed.
